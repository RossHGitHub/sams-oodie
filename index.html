    <p>Might <em>not</em> shock you to find out that Sam wears this every.. single.. night. </p>

    <p>In this site, we'll explore just 3 elements of what makes her fall asleep before 6:30pm.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="./pages/sam1.html">Half drunken Bottle of water.</a></li>
        <li> <a href="./pages/sam2.html">The lying-down position.</a></li>
        <li> <a href="./pages/sam3.html">Tik-Tok</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Something important..</h2>

    <p>This website was created for the all the victims of 
        falling asleep before 7pm. Millions of programs get
        unfinished. Royalties incorrectly paid out to film 
        and TV makers everywhere, it's a scam really. It's no 
        wonder Netflix is plummeting right now...</p>
